change log:

---- 1.5.9 ----
fixed BX count in BC0 lock check
fixed L1 ID to start from 1 rather than 0
FIFOs do not assert FULL during reset, so HAD_OVF flags shouldn't be set after reset anymore
fixed GBT loopback with OH in the loop

---- 1.5.10 ----
Fixed phase TXUSRCLK
GBT TX Latency Optimized mode

---- 1.7.0 ----
Slow control added:
  * GBTx internal control (lets write/read GBTx internal registers)
  * SCA controller
    - configures SCA chip during reset
    - resets OH FPGA on TTC hard reset command or user request
    - reads SCA ADC channels automatically and stores the values in registers (reading can be disabled by the user)
    - drives the SCA JTAG module based on data provided by the user on simple 32bit TMS and TDO registers, also reads TDI data when reading TDI reg
  * Improved ipbus-slave and generate_registers.py: provides write and read pulses and also write_done and read_ready signals can be used for transactional reads / writes
